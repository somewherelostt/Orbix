# Upload Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. VATRefundPage Upload Issues

**Problems Found:**
- Inconsistent wallet address validation (42 vs 58 vs 66 characters)
- Missing proper file validation in upload handler
- No console logging for debugging
- Minimal error feedback to users

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Standardized Aptos wallet address validation to 66 characters starting with '0x'
- ✅ Added proper file type validation (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- ✅ Added file size validation (max 10MB)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging
- ✅ Clear error messages when user starts typing

### 2. BulkUploadModal Validation Issue

**Problem Found:**
- Wallet address validation expected 58+ characters (Aptos format)
- Should validate for Aptos addresses (66 characters starting with 0x)

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated validation to check for proper Aptos wallet format

## Key Improvements

### VATRefundPage.tsx
```typescript
// Before: Inconsistent validation
if (formData.receiverWalletAddress.length !== 42) // Upload mode
if (formData.receiverWalletAddress.length !== 58) // Manual mode

// After: Consistent validation
if (formData.receiverWalletAddress.length !== 66 || !formData.receiverWalletAddress.startsWith('0x'))
```

### File Upload Validation
```typescript
// Added proper file validation
const allowedTypes = ['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/jpg'];
if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
  setErrorMessage("Please select a valid file type (PDF, JPG, PNG)");
  return;
}

const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
if (file.size > maxSize) {
  setErrorMessage("File size must be less than 10MB");
  return;
}
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
// Clear errors when user starts typing
if (errorMessage) {
  setErrorMessage(null);
}

// Better console logging
console.log("Processing uploaded file:", selectedFile.name);
console.log("File size:", selectedFile.size, "bytes");
console.log("File type:", selectedFile.type);
```

## How to Test

1. **PDF Upload Mode:**
   - Select a PDF, JPG, or PNG file
   - Enter a valid Aptos wallet address (66 characters starting with 0x)
   - Click "Upload Document" - should now process and move to review step

2. **Manual Entry Mode:**
   - Fill in all required fields including a valid Aptos wallet address
   - Click submit - should now process and move to review step

3. **CSV Bulk Upload:**
   - Upload a CSV file with valid Aptos wallet addresses
   - Should properly validate addresses during processing

## Expected Behavior Now

- ✅ Upload button becomes active when all required fields are filled
- ✅ Proper validation messages for invalid wallet addresses
- ✅ File type and size validation before processing
- ✅ Console logs for debugging upload process
- ✅ Smooth transition to review step after successful upload/form submission
- ✅ Clear error messages that disappear when user starts correcting input

The upload functionality should now work properly for both PDF upload and manual data entry modes!
